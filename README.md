# treasure_map

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In this game, players explore a beautifully designed interactive treasure map, zooming and panning to search for six uniquely hidden treasures. Each treasure has a special location and intriguing description, and when found, the markers change visually to show your progress. The game automatically saves your discoveries so you can pick up right where you left off.

Getting started is easy: you can either download the project ZIP or clone the repository. After setting up Flutter and your device or emulator, install the required dependencies with flutter pub get and run the app with flutter run. The project structure is clean and well-organized, making it straightforward to customize â€” you can add more treasures, swap the background map, or tweak the UI colors to fit your style.

Built with the Provider package for efficient state management and Shared Preferences for saving progress, this app offers smooth animations and intuitive controls for a great user experience.
